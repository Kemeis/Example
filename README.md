# Example – Portfolio Project

This project is a 360° virtual tour of an architectural design, created as part of my portfolio. The 2D floor plans were designed in AutoCAD, and the 3D model was created in SketchUp. The 3D renderings were produced using V-Ray for realistic visualization. The project is displayed on a website using HTML.
